# Chat with your PDF using Gemini ü§ñ

This is a Streamlit application that allows you to chat with your PDF documents using Google's Gemini Pro model. You can upload a PDF, and the application will create a vector store of the document's content. You can then ask questions about the document, and the application will use the Gemini Pro model to generate answers based on the document's content.
