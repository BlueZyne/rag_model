# Chat with your PDF using Gemini 🤖

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://ireadpdf.streamlit.app/)

**[View the live application](https://ireadpdf.streamlit.app/)**

This is a production-ready Streamlit application that allows you to chat with your PDF documents using Google's Gemini models. Upload PDFs, and the application creates a vector store of the document's content. Ask questions, and the application uses Gemini AI to generate accurate answers based on your documents.

## Architecture 🏗️

This application follows a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture:

1.  **PDF Processing:** Extracts text from uploaded PDFs using `PyPDF` library with error handling.
2.  **Text Chunking:** Splits text into 1000-character chunks with 200-character overlap using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
3.  **Embedding and Vector Store:** Converts chunks to embeddings using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and stores in FAISS vector store with metadata.
4.  **Question Classification:** Analyzes question complexity to route to appropriate Gemini model.
5.  **Question Answering:** Performs similarity search, retrieves relevant chunks, and generates answers using Gemini with chat history context.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

*   **Streamlit:** Interactive web application framework
*   **LangChain:** Framework for building LLM applications (text splitting, prompts, chains)
*   **Google Gemini 2.0:** Advanced AI models (Flash for speed, Thinking for complex reasoning)
*   **FAISS:** Efficient similarity search library
*   **Hugging Face Embeddings:** `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for text embeddings
*   **PyPDF:** PDF text extraction
*   **Python Logging:** Production-grade logging system

## Installation and Setup ⚙️

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BlueZyne/rag_model.git
    cd rag_model
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv third
    source third/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `third\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your API key:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    *   Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    *   Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

## Usage 🚀

1.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Upload your PDF:**
    *   Open the application in your browser (usually `http://localhost:8501`)
    *   Use the file uploader in the sidebar to upload PDF documents (max 50MB each)
    *   Documents are automatically processed when uploaded
    *   View statistics for each document in the sidebar

3.  **Configure AI Settings (Optional):**
    *   Adjust the **Temperature** slider (0.0-1.0) to control AI creativity
        *   Lower (0.0-0.3): More focused and deterministic responses
        *   Medium (0.4-0.7): Balanced creativity and accuracy
        *   Higher (0.8-1.0): More creative and varied responses

4.  **Filter Documents (Multi-Document Mode):**
    *   When multiple PDFs are uploaded, use checkboxes to select which documents to search
    *   Only selected documents will be used to answer your questions

5.  **Chat with your PDF:**
    *   Once documents are processed, ask questions in the chat input
    *   The AI will automatically choose the best model based on question complexity
    *   View source citations to see which documents were referenced

6.  **Monitor Usage:**
    *   View real-time token usage and estimated costs in the sidebar
    *   Track your API consumption across the session

7.  **Export your conversation:**
    *   Click "💾 Export Chat" in the sidebar
    *   Download your chat history as a markdown file with metadata
    *   Includes session ID, token usage, and costs

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues

**"GOOGLE_API_KEY not found"**
- Ensure you've created a `.env` file in the project root
- Verify the API key is correctly formatted: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- Check that the `.env` file is in the same directory as `app.py`

**"No text could be extracted from the PDF"**
- The PDF might be scanned/image-based. Try using OCR software first
- The PDF might be corrupted. Try opening it in a PDF reader
- The PDF might be password-protected. Remove protection first

**"API quota exceeded"**
- You've hit your Google AI API rate limit
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check your quota at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/)

**"File size exceeds maximum"**
- Maximum file size is 50MB per PDF
- Try compressing the PDF or splitting it into smaller files

**Memory errors**
- Try uploading fewer documents at once
- Restart the application to clear memory
- Close other applications to free up RAM

## Production Deployment 🚀

This application is production-ready with:
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- File validation and size limits
- Rate limiting protection
- Efficient memory management
- User-friendly error messages

For deployment to Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or other platforms:
1. Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore` (it is by default)
2. Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` as an environment variable in your deployment platform
3. The app will automatically use environment variables if `.env` is not found
